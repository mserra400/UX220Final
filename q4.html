    <h1>A .png and .jpg Comparison</h1>
<!-- add reasons below -->
    <section>
        <h2>Why .pngs are better than .jpg</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reason 1: .png files maintain their quality even after multiple saves, which makes them ideal for high-resolution graphics and logos.</li>
            <li>Reason 2: Their backgrounds can be transparent, which is great for logos and other items that need to blend in with various backdrops.</li>
            <li>Reason 3: .pngs preserve the sharpness of images with text or extremely distinct lines, which is useful for screenshots and other uses .
</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why .pngs are not as good as .jpgs </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reason 1: .pngs, particually for photos, typically have greater file sizes than .jpgs. When attempting to optimize web pages for quicker loading times, this could be an issue.</li>
            <li>Reason 2: .pngs can handle countless colours, but because of their greater file sizes, they may not be as effective as .jpgs for representing complex, high-quality photographic images.</li>
            <li>Reason 3: .jpgs tend to perform better than .pngs when it comes to print materials since they can produce high-quality images with relatively reduced file sizes. For items like magazines or brochures, this is important.</li>
