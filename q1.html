        <p>The form is attempting to send data to a local address. Since this form is attempting to send data to a local address (localhost), which is not accessible from the internet, it will not function on GitHub Pages.</p>

        <h2>https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/</h2>
        <p>This form may work on GitHub Pages because it's posting data to the app Heroku, which is a remote server accessible over https. However, GitHub Pages may restrict form submissions to external domains for security reasons.</p>
